This package that I will be developing will return the basic descriptive statistics of each column. The output will include any parameters like.

mean, median, mode, standard deviation, variance, maximum, minimum, range, number of rows, structure of each column and quantiles.

Although, these are easy to create but the main motivation for this package is to print out all the important statistics in a single command.
